# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

Created an earthquake map with 3 different maps, Major Earthquakes, and Tectonic Plates. The map includes circles that can be clicked and display the magnitude and location information. They are also color coded and scaled based on the magnitude of the earthquake. The map includes buttons you can click to turn on and off earthquake data, tectonic data, and major earthquake data. The 3 different map types are street, satellite, and dark.
